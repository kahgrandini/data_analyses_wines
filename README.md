Author: karina Grandini Cramer

folder: red-wine-statistical-analise.ipynb

## 📖 Overview
This project is a capstone for "Google Data Analyses certification". The analyzes is based on physicochemical properties of wine to determine their relationship with wine quality tasting. Using data analysis and visualization techniques, we explore factors that influence wine ratings.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine
- **Description:** The dataset contains physicochemical properties and sensory quality ratings of red and white wines.
- **Key Features:**
  - Acidity, pH, alcohol content, etc.
  - Sensory ratings from experts.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify key physicochemical properties affecting wine quality when tasting.
- Perform statistical analysis and visualization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **R programming** 
- **Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle**
- **VS Code** for development

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates and transformations.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing correlations.
3. **Hypothesis Testing:** Checking statistical significance of features.

## 📈 Visualizations
